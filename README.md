Dissertation Project: Anomaly Detection in Behavioural Patterns of Elderly Individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment using Hidden Markov Model

Previously, HMM has been applied to model the behaviour of elderly individuals and detect anomalous behaviour with good results. While these efforts have yielded valuable insights, the existing literature appears to lack a focused evaluation of HMM to profile normal behaviour and detect abnormal behaviour specifically in the context of gradual cognitive decline observed in individuals affected by aMCI and naMCI. To bridge this gap, this study aims to assess the effectiveness of HMM in detecting deviations in activity patterns of elderly people afflicted with aMCI and naMCI.

To that end, the research objectives include:
1. Develop a robust methodology for simulating abnormal behaviour patterns that mimic the gradual cognitive decline observed in aMCI and naMCI. This involves introducing a diverse range of anomalous behaviours that closely resembles real-life MCI scenarios.
2. Assess the effectiveness of an HMM-based anomaly detection framework in detecting simulated behavioural deviations resembling varying levels of cognitive impairment seen in aMCI and naMCI.
3. Compare the anomaly detection capabilities of HMM to other state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, namely Long short-term memory (LSTM) and autoencoder, to discern their performance and limitations in detecting MCI-related behavioural deviations.
